Dataquest-Projects

This repository contains the projects that i completed during a Data Science course I had taken. The course I had taken up was the Data Scientist path in  Python by Dataquest. I found their course extremely helpful in building up a strong data science foundation, something I can build upon more now. The course included several different types of projects to demonstrate different skills. Here are a few different types of projects that I build:
Data Cleaning Project – to show that I can tae many data sets clean them, and combine them for analysis.
Data Storytelling Project – to demostrate that I can extract insights from data, communicate these insights and reason with data. 
Data Visualization Project – to show that I can communicate data visually using appropriate plots and charts.
Machine Learning Project – to effectively build a model that makes accurate predictions with data 
End to End Project – to build a stand-alone system that can take in data, processes it and produce output in a specific form.

These projects are made in Jupyter notebooks and contain mardowns to expain the process and results that can be concluded. These projects are not exhaustive and tehy can be expanded to give more insight.
