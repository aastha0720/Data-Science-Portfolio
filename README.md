# Data Science Portfolio

Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self-learning purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.


## Machine Learning

* [Building a Handwritten Digits Classifier](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Building%20A%20Handwritten%20Digits%20Classifier.ipynb) - Implemented a deep, feedforward neural network for classifying images of handwritten text and compared the accuracies of k-nearest neighbors model with neural network model. 
* [Spam Filter](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Spam%20Filter.ipynb) – Implemented a spam filter to classify a new message as a Spam or Ham using Naïve Bayes Algorithm. 
* [Predicting House Sale Prices](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Predicting%20House%20Sale%20Prices.ipynb)- To predict house sale prices using Linear Regression. K-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the model. 
* [Predicting Bike Rentals](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Predicting%20Bike%20Rentals.ipynb) – To predict the total number of bikes people would rent in a given hour using decision trees and random forest. 

## Data Analysis and Visualization
* [Analyze Employee Exit Surveys](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Clean%20and%20Analyze%20Employee%20Exit%20Surveys.ipynb) - Clean and analyze exit surveys from employees to answer questions regarding the common reasons for separation.
* [Analyzing Used Car Listings on eBay](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Analyzing%20Used%20Car%20Listings%20on%20eBay%20Kleinanzeigen.ipynb) – Using the car listings on ebay to analyze the general trend of second hand car selling deals based on data like mileage, year of making, price and brand.
* [Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Profitable%20App%20Profiles%20for%20the%20App%20Store%20and%20Google%20Play%20Markets.ipynb) – The aim of the project is to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets.
* [Exploring Hackers News Posts](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Exploring%20Hackers%20News%20Posts.ipynb) – Using the data set from Hacker News to analyse and compare the two types of posts, Ask HN and Show HN, on the site.

## Probability and Statistics  
* [Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Investigating%20Fandango%20Movie%20Ratings.ipynb)- An exploratory investigation on the Fandango movie ratings to analyze whether they corrected their ratings after bias was found in earlier data. 
* [Finding the Best Markets to Advertise In](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Finding%20the%20Best%20Markets%20to%20Advertise%20In.ipynb)- An exploratory project to find out the best market to advertise for edtech platform using statistics. 
* [Mobile App for Lottery Addiction](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Mobile%20App%20for%20Lottery%20Addiction.ipynb)- Create a mobile app model to help lottery addicts better estimate their chances of winning using probability combinatorics.

## Micro Projects
* [Predicting Car Prices](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Predicting%20Car%20Prices.ipynb) – To Predict the process of cars based on technical aspects using KNN model.
* [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/TItanic%20Competition.ipynb) – The famous Titanic Competition on Kaggle, to predict the survivors on RMS Titanic
* [Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQLite and Python](https://github.com/aastha0720/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/master/Analyzing%20CIA%20Factbook%20Data%20Using%20SQLite%20and%20Python.ipynb) - An exploratory project to analyze the CIA factbook data using SQLite and Python.
