Dataquest-Projects

This repository contains the projects that I completed during a Data Science course I had taken. The course was the Data Scientist path in  Python by Dataquest. I found their course extremely helpful in building a strong data science foundation, something which I can build upon more now. The course included several different types of projects to demonstrate different skills. Here are a few different types of projects that I build:
* Data Cleaning Project – to demostrate how to clean different data sets and combine them for analysis.
* Data Storytelling Project – to demostrate how to extract insights from data, communicate these insights and reason with data. 
* Data Visualization Project – to help communicate data visually using appropriate plots and charts.
* Machine Learning Project – to effectively build a model that makes accurate predictions with data 
* End to End Project – to build a stand-alone system that can take in data, processes it and produce output in a specific form.

These projects are made in Jupyter notebooks and contain markdowns to expain the process and results that can be concluded. These projects are not exhaustive and they can be expanded to give more insight.
